# Video Conferencing with Mediasoup

## Overview

This is a **many-to-many** video conferencing project built using **Mediasoup**, where up to **five active speakers** are showcased in a room. The application leverages **WebRTC, Socket.IO, Node.js, and Express.js** to enable seamless real-time communication between multiple participants.

## Features

- **Many-to-Many Video Conferencing**
- **Mediasoup for SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) Streaming**
- **Displays Up to 5 Active Speakers**
- **Low Latency Communication with WebRTC**
- **Socket.IO for Real-time Signaling**
- **Scalable and Efficient Media Handling**

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Media Server:** Mediasoup
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **WebRTC for Media Streaming**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **NPM or Yarn**

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application** Open your browser and go to:

   ```

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js          # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/            # Frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/        # Mediasoup configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sockets/       # Socket.IO logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rooms/         # Room management logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Helper functions
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Project Documentation
```

## How It Works

1. **Users Join a Room**
   - Each user connects via WebRTC and is assigned a producer/consumer role.
2. **Mediasoup Manages Media Streams**
   - SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) optimizes video/audio distribution.
3. **Socket.IO Handles Signaling**
   - Real-time communication for session management.
4. **Active Speaker Detection**
   - Displays the top 5 active speakers in the conference.
